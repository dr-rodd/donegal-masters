# Donegal Masters

A golf tournament scoring app for a 3-round family competition at Rosapenna Resort, Co. Donegal.

## App Overview

- 12 players across 4 family teams (3 players each: 1 dad, 1 mum, 1 son)
- 3 rounds, one per course at Rosapenna Resort
- Hole-by-hole stableford scoring
- Team leaderboard based on best stableford score per hole per round

## Design Philosophy

This is a **mobile-first app**. All UI code must be designed and optimised for mobile by default.

- Write styles for mobile first; use `sm:` / `md:` / `lg:` breakpoints only to enhance for larger screens where it adds value
- Touch targets must be large enough for fingers (minimum 44px)
- Layouts, spacing, and typography should feel native on a phone screen
- The only time desktop-specific logic is needed is for interactions that are inherently mobile-only (e.g. swipe gestures) — in those cases, provide a desktop fallback

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 16 (App Router, TypeScript)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (mobile-first utility classes)
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Supabase client:** `lib/supabase.ts` — import as `import { supabase } from '@/lib/supabase'`
- **Package manager:** npm

## Courses

| Round | Course |
|-------|--------|
| 1 | Old Tom Morris |
| 2 | St Patrick's Links |
| 3 | Sandy Hills |

## Players

| Category | Players (handicap) |
|----------|--------------------|
| Dads | John (11.9), Martin (14), Peter (18), Paul (14.6) |
| Mums | Aisling (21.1), Eithne (26), Liz (22), Gillian (24) |
| Sons | Ross (9.4), Matthew (5.1), Dave (3.3), Sam (12) |

Teams are pre-assigned before play (one from each category per team).

## Database Schema

### Tables (in schema.sql)

| Table | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `teams` | 4 teams, each with a `name` and `color` (hex) |
| `players` | 12 players, each with `team_id`, `name`, `role` (dad/mum/child), `handicap` |
| `courses` | One row per course |
| `holes` | 18 holes per course — `hole_number`, `par`, `stroke_index` |
| `rounds` | Links `round_number` (1–3) to a `course_id`, has a `status` (upcoming/active/completed) |
| `round_handicaps` | Snapshot of each player's `playing_handicap` per round — use this for scoring, not `players.handicap` |
| `scores` | One row per player/hole/round — `gross_score` and auto-calculated `stableford_points` |

### Live Scoring Tables (in Supabase only, not in schema.sql)

These tables power the active scoring flow and exist only in the Supabase database:

| Table | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `live_rounds` | Tracks active scoring sessions per player/round. Includes `session_finalised_at` (timestamptz) to mark when a session is finalised |
| `live_scores` | Hole-by-hole scores during active play, before finalisation |
| `live_player_locks` | Prevents multiple concurrent scoring sessions for the same player/round |

### Views

| View | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `leaderboard_by_round` | Best stableford score per hole per team per round, with `running_team_total` |
| `leaderboard_summary` | Total team points per round, ordered by score descending |

### Key Constraints

- One dad, one mum, one son per team — dad/mum uniqueness enforced via partial unique indexes
- One score per player per hole per round (unique constraint)
- Each course played only once across the 3 rounds

## Stableford Scoring Rules

Points are calculated automatically by a PostgreSQL trigger (`trg_scores_stableford`) on every insert/update to `scores`.

**Formula:**
```
shots_received = FLOOR(playing_handicap / 18) + (1 if stroke_index <= playing_handicap % 18 else 0)
net_score      = gross_score - shots_received
points         = GREATEST(0, par + 2 - net_score)
```

**Points reference:**
| Result | Points |
|--------|--------|
| Albatross (3 under) | 5 |
| Eagle (2 under) | 4 |
| Birdie (1 under) | 3 |
| Par | 2 |
| Bogey (1 over) | 1 |
| Double bogey or worse | 0 |

**NR handling:** NR = max score for the hole = 0 Stableford points. Max nett per hole is capped at the score giving 0 points (i.e. one over par after handicap strokes applied).

**Nett total display:** `nett total = course par + 36 − Stableford points`. Leaderboard display uses a "vs 2pts/hole baseline" convention.

## Team Scoring

The team score for each hole is the **best (highest) stableford points** scored by any member of that team on that hole. The team leaderboard sums these best-ball scores across all 18 holes.

## App Architecture

### Page Structure

| Route | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `app/page.tsx` | Home page |
| Course portal page | Three course cards with green glow for active rounds, completed badges |
| Per-course dashboards | Live dashboards showing active scorecard cards |
| Score entry UI | Standalone tile component with left/right hole navigation |
| Post-round summary | Player tile navigation with provisional edit mode |

### Course Dashboard Features

- Active scorecard cards per player
- Settings tab with player state management (void active rounds, unfinalise finalised rounds)
- Finalise Session button (sets `session_finalised_at` on `live_rounds`)

### Background Jobs

- **Abandoned scorecard cleanup:** Vercel cron route that cleans up abandoned `live_rounds` entries. Requires `CRON_SECRET` env variable. Implemented as a Supabase SQL migration + Next.js API route.

## Data Insertion Order

When seeding, respect foreign key constraints:
1. `teams`
2. `players`
3. `courses`
4. `holes`
5. `rounds`
6. `round_handicaps`
7. `scores`

## Environment Variables
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...
CRON_SECRET=...
```

Stored in `.env.local` (gitignored).

**Known security issue:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is currently exposed client-side. Must be moved to a server-side env variable with RLS enabled before any public release. Do not add new client-side uses of the service role key.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `app/page.tsx` | Home page |
| `app/layout.tsx` | Root layout |
| `lib/supabase.ts` | Supabase client |
| `supabase/schema.sql` | Database schema (does NOT include live_rounds/live_scores/live_player_locks — those exist only in Supabase) |

## Player States (Live Scoring)

Players in a live session exist in exactly one state at all times:

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Available | Not yet assigned to any scorecard in this session |
| Active | Currently assigned to an in-progress scorecard |
| Finalised | Scorecard completed and committed |

A player cannot appear in more than one state simultaneously. Finalised players are not available for reselection unless manually unfinalised via the course dashboard settings tab.

A live session is only marked complete when every available player has a finalised scorecard, or an admin manually triggers Finalise Session in settings.

## Scoring Display Conventions

- Stableford display: running total vs 2pts per hole baseline — show as +/- relative to that baseline, higher is better
- Gross display: score vs par at holes played — lower is better
- Nett display: (course par + 36 - stableford points) for finalised rounds. For rounds in progress, scale baseline to holes completed. Show as +/- relative to par, lower is better.
- Colour treatment: gold for better than baseline, green for better than par nett, standard for worse
- Live leaderboard colour treatment: gold for over par or behind handicap (replaces red — most amateur scores will be in this range so it should not read as negative); green for stableford better than handicap; green nett for better than par nett (unchanged). Avoid red as a score indicator throughout the app.

## Design Principles

- Mobile-first app used by older users — prioritise large, legible text and generous touch targets
- Numbers conveying key information (scores, points, positions) must be immediately readable at a glance on a phone screen
- Paper scorecard style for review screens: parchment cream background, ink-style symbols
- Score symbols: solid circle (eagle), thin ring (birdie), blank (par), thin rounded square ring (bogey), light gold fill in rounded square (double bogey or worse)
- Claude.ai leads all design decisions before prompting Claude Code — clarify requirements first, then issue structured prompts

## Prompting Guidelines for Claude Code

- Prompts must be succinct and robust — avoid over-specifying logic the codebase already handles
- Target specific files or components where possible
- Avoid unnecessary token usage — do not run broad sitewide audits when a targeted fix will do
- Build in chunks with testing between dependent steps
- Prefer automated/CLI approaches over manual dashboard steps
- User is not a coder — prompts should be clear and copiable without modification

## Site Config

Competition name and branding live in `config/site.ts` to allow easy spinout for future competitions. Do not hardcode competition name in components — import from config.
